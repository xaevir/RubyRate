This demo shows the basic transport functionality by allowing file uploads to
be done asynchronously (that is, without a full page load).

To run this example, you'll need node.js and npm, and the node modules
"formidable" and "paperboy".

    $ npm install formidable paperboy
    $ node server.js

Then load the URL http://localhost:8080/ and do some uploading.
